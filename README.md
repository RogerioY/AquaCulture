*ARCHIVE of game jam project between two friends, based on the Unity 2D Game Kit*

This is a farming sim set underwater we worked on some years ago, extending the Unity 2D Game Kit.

The changelist history may be lost to it (as we used Unity Collaborate, which was deprecated, in favour of PlasticSCM, which then deleted our remote repository...), but maybe can be recovered through a local migration.

There's a few gameplay mechanics, aethetic ideas, crude humour (at my expense), and uses several different Unity features. It's playable but very buggy, with some features being activated by pressing the melee key 'K'.

The survival game genre has moved on a lot since we made this. :)
